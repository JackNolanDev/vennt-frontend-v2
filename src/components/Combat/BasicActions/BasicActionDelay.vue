  <h2>Delay</h2>
  <p>
    On your turn, while you still have Actions to spend, you may postpone the
    remainder of your turn, moving yourself down in the turn order to a position
    you specify when Delaying. This adjusts your Initiative score to be
    considered 1 lower than the creature you place yourself behind in the turn
    order.
  </p>
  <p>
    You can Delay until the next Round; however, doing so does
    <strong>not</strong> grant you the 3 Actions and 1 Reaction you receive each
    Round. For example, you could spend 2 Actions and then Delay to the start of
    the next Round, but you would only have 1 Action left to use for entirety of
    that Round. If you Delay until the start of the next Round, your Initiative
    score becomes 1 higher than the highest creature in the turn order.
